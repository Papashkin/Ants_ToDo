# Ant's ToDo's application

## Description
This application for "to-do" lists managing (create, modify, delete).


## Architecture
It's first application which based on [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architectural pattern.

## Features
1. I'm trying to use here the [coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/ui/coroutines-guide-ui.md) instead Rx;
2. [Kodein](https://github.com/Kodein-Framework/Kodein-DI) instead Dagger as a DI framework;
3. All data stores in SQL database and managed via [Room library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room).
4. [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) for bind data and view.
